# Instanews #

Instanews is an web application that helps user access the most recent articles from NY Times online magazine on a variety of topics.

## Technologies Used ##

To create this application, the following technologies were used:

**HTML5**,
**CSS3**,
**jQuery**,
**Node.js**,
**Ajax**,
**JSON**,
**API**,
**SASS**,
**Gulp**



## Personal Learnings ##

The Instanews was a great introduction to Ajax, JSON, Node.js, Sass and Gulp technologies. Ajax is a method that allows retreiving information asynchronously by sending a request using API, in our case open NY Times API. JSON is a file format that stores encoded simple and complex data structures. JSON files allow convenient usage of complex data. With Node.js I was able to use my computer as a server for the Instanews app. I installed a set of packages that sipmlified work on the application with Gulp. Among the installed packages were eslint, uglify, and browser-sync.
